# Data Structures and Algorithms Library

This is placeholder text.

* *adts*: Contains definitions of common abstract data types (ADTs) and detailed, comprehensive implementations of data structures that implement those ADTs. The code here is older and not as useful for active problem-solving as the structures are too verbose.
* *algorithms*: Contains implementations of essential algorithms.
* *cheat-sheet*: Contains a LaTeX document that is designed to direct a user to the correct problem-solving approach as quickly as possible.
* *problems*: Contains hundreds of DS&A problems and the solutions to those problems.
* *structures*: Contains implementations of essential data structures that are not part of the Python standard library.
